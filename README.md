## Notable projects

In no particular order

- **[Chat App](https://github.com/tycrek-archive/chat-app)** - End-to-end encrypted messaging. The encryption part works, never did the messaging.
- **[garage.py](https://github.com/tycrek-archive/garage.py)** - Gutted a garage door remote, hooked it up to a 5v relay and a Raspberry Pi. Added Twilio integration and I could open my garage, hands-free ("`ok google, call Garage Door`" then "`open`" voice command).
- **[Ravisher](https://github.com/tycrek-archive/ravisher)** - A self-hosted Rarbg frontend that adds torrents directly to qBittorrent.
- **[Spark (for Reddit)](https://github.com/tycrek-archive/sparkreddit)** - Open-source Reddit client that was mostly just for experimenting with Dart & Flutter.
- **[BabyMonitor](https://github.com/tycrek-archive/BabyMonitor)** - A self-hosted web app to easily check up on all devices on your local network. Yes, the name is terrible, I know.
- **[ColonConvert](https://github.com/tycrek-archive/ColonConvert)** - Convert an image to characters for easy copy/paste memes.
- **[randimg](https://github.com/tycrek-archive/randimg)** - Generates random images over and over.
- **[pic2ascii](https://github.com/tycrek-archive/pic2ascii)** - Converts an image to another image... where every pixel is a letter/number/symbol
- **[jRDP](https://github.com/tycrek-archive/jrdp)** - Remote desktop, but in Java, and over TCP, because why would someone want good performance?
- **[wpa2hasher](https://github.com/tycrek-archive/wpa2hasher)** - Android app for generating WPA2 **hashes**. Had it on the Google Play Store but took it off because too many IDIOTS gave it low reviews for "not cracking passwords" EVEN THOUGH I NEVER SAID IT DID
- **[aeft (Android Easy File Transfer)](https://github.com/tycrek-archive/aeft)** - File sharing app between an Android device and a PC.
- **[chat-program (Chatva)](https://github.com/tycrek-archive/chat-program)** - Barely my code, but one of my very first somewhat-long-term projects so it's special.
- **[TracerouteMap](https://github.com/tycrek-archive/TracerouteMap)** - Builds a Google Earth "tour map" thing based on the results of a traceroute.
